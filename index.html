              <h3><b>Advanced Imaging</b></h3>
              <p> Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) designs endeavor to accommodate signals having a wide dynamic range. The key design challenge is to maintain ROIC sensitivity to low-light signal levels while simultaneously not clipping high level signals within a frame. This intra-frame dynamic range requirement often leads to making less-than-optimal global settings like frame gain, through a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), or shutter time to preserve the integrity of the maximum signal acquired during a given frame exposure time. The global imaging settings allow for the utilization of the pixel maximum full-well capacity while compromising the integrity of dark signal levels. The new SenseICs High Dynamic Range (HDR) ROIC architecture utilizes a novel Intelligent Context Adaptive Sensing (ICAS) technology enabling not only intra-frame HDR but also reconfigurable frame-by-frame functions like auto exposure, Region of Interest (ROI) windowing, and event-driven, low-power imaging. The specialized front-end analog-digital technology enables a new generation of smart ROICs with on-the-fly adaptive reconfigurability and efficient image processing back-end.</p>

	      <h3><b>High Radiation Environments</b></h3>
              <p> Despite the trend of inherent enhanced total ionizing dose (TID) hardness of deep submicron CMOS technologies, TID effects remain a significant problem in IC design for space or nuclear applications. Additionally, transiting radiation causes single event effects (SEE) that disturb the operation of both analog and digital ICs at any process node. SenseICs is skilled in the process to mitigate these effects throughout the IC design cycle. Furthermore, SenseICs is versed in radiation effects testing and developing data acquisition systems for validating IC radiation tolerance and SEE immunity.</p>
